# keyword mode. `score_text`'s raw overlap count alone isn't a safe filter:
# a single shared word out of many query tokens (score > 0) is not the same
# claim as "this document is actually about what was asked".
#
# 0.3, not something tighter: real natural-language questions about one
# specific topic routinely surround the one real content word with 2-3
# generic ones ("is it safe to eat ragi during pregnancy" tokenizes to
# {safe, eat, ragi} after stopwords -- a real, single-topic question, but
# only "ragi" actually overlaps the matching document, for a ratio of
# 1/3 = 0.333). A 0.34 floor rejected that live query outright (verified:
# it fell through to "insufficient evidence" for a question the corpus
# genuinely could answer) -- 0.3 keeps that same 1-real-word-in-~3 case
# working while still rejecting a long unrelated/adversarial query that
# shares only one incidental word with a document (a 7-8 token query with a
# single overlap scores ~0.13-0.14, well under this floor).

# Verified live: "When is my next prenatal checkup?" scored a flat 0 against
# the FOGSI antenatal-care document and fell through to "insufficient
# evidence", even though it is the exact question that document answers --
# the document's actual words are "antenatal" and "visit"/"contact", never
# "prenatal" or "checkup". Keyword overlap can only ever match the literal
# string a source happened to use, so it is blind to any synonym a real user
# reaches for instead -- a plain relevance-ratio fix (MIN_KEYWORD_RELEVANCE)
# can't help this case at all, since the true overlap is zero either way.
# This maps a handful of common alternate phrasings, drawn from vocabulary
# that actually appears in this corpus, onto the corpus's own word before
# scoring -- deliberately small and corpus-grounded rather than a general
# thesaurus, so it closes known real gaps without inflating matches on
# words nothing here actually discusses.
