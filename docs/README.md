## Keeping the docs true

Numbers in the docs come from the code: run `python -m app.safety.guardrails` in `backend/` for the rule counts, and the test commands in [`testing.md`](./testing.md) for the test counts. When you change behaviour, change the page that describes it in the same pull request, and add an entry to [`../PROGRESS.md`](../PROGRESS.md).
